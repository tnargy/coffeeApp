# Delta for Sales

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Void a sale
When the operator voids a sale, the system MUST return its bags to available, and MUST leave the sale out of the sales history, sales total, and P&L.

#### Scenario: Voided sale returns its bags
- **GIVEN** a sale of one bag
- **WHEN** the operator voids that sale
- **THEN** the bag is available again
- **AND** the sale is no longer counted in sales total or P&L

#### Scenario: Voided sale stays in the record list
- **GIVEN** a sale that has been voided
- **WHEN** the operator opens the records list
- **THEN** the sale is listed, marked void with its reason
